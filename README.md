# Medium Stats Vizor

Enhances Medium's stats page by displaying real-time "Today Views", "Today Reads", and "Yesterday Earnings" for each story — without leaving the page.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This tool is unofficial and not affiliated with Medium. It only reads publicly available data from your own account for convenience.

<br/>

## ✨ Features

-   Adds **Today Views** and **Today Reads (Member)** next to each story
-   Fetches **Yesterday's Earnings** and **Member Reads**
-   Fetches and updates the data in real-time without refreshing the page.
-   Lightweight and integrates smoothly with Medium's original design.
